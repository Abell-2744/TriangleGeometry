# Triangle Geometry

The users, of this program will use the command line to enter 3 numbers to classify triangles, based on three numbers entered. The numbers represent the lengths of three line segments that may be able to be arranged to form a triangle.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Javascript ES5/ES6
Node.js
Mocha.js
Chai.js

### Installing

Go to http://nodejs.org, download and install version 7.8.0

Download source code from .....

## Running the tests
npm install mocha
npm install chai

npm test

### And coding style tests

Sample Test input:
1.5 1.5 1.5   //Equallitaral
3 4 4         //Isosceles
4.4 7.3 9.1   //Scalene
4 6 11        //Not a Triangle

Sample test output:
  Triangle Geometry
    ✓ should be equilateral
    ✓ should be isosceles
    ✓ should be scalene
    ✓ should be not a triangle
  4 passing (10ms)
